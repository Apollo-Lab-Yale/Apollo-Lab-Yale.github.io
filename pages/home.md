Welcome to the Applied Planning, Learning, and Optimization (Apollo) Lab at Yale University! At the intersection of robotics, optimization, and machine learning, our lab explores the realms of robotics planning and learning from an applied perspective to engineer sophisticated algorithms and tools that advance the capabilities of robotic systems. By melding theoretical principles with real-world applications, we unravel new methodologies that bolster robotic intelligence and autonomy in complex, dynamic environments.
