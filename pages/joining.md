### PhD Positions

If you would like to work in the APOLLO Lab at Yale as a PhD student research assistant, apply to the PhD Program at Yale via the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and mention that you are interested in working with Daniel Rakita in your application.  Applications are typically due in December and, if admitted, the program would start for you the following Fall.  Through the application/ interview/ visiting process, we would naturally assess if the APOLLO Lab would be a good fit for you.    

### Undergraduate Research Positions

We are always looking for motivated undergraduate researchers to help on or lead various projects in the lab.  If you are an undergraduate student already at Yale and interested in research pertaining to robot planning, learning, or optimization, please email Daniel Rakita at [daneil.rakita@yale.edu](mailto:daniel.rakita@yale.edu).
